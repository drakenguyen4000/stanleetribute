                        <p id="unique">Stan Lee born on December 28, 1922 was comic book writer, editor, and publisher
                            that helped create some of the most iconic superheroes in American pop culture. His beloved
                            creations included Spiderman, Hulk, the Fantastic Four, Thor, Iron Man, and a host of
                            characters while working under comic book publisher Marvel Comics. Unlike other super heroes
                            at the time, Stan Lee set out to make his heroes more relatable to the average reader. His
                            characters had uncanny abilities, yet those powers often times came as a burden to the
                            character. His characters' stories were driven by the person under the mask rather than just
                            about their masked alter egos. These characters were marred by everyday life problems that
                            he and his readers faced. These vigilantes did not live in some mythical city but rather in
                            real world cities such as New York, Jersey City, Los Angeles, etc. With this approach, his
                            characters became as beloved by readers around the world as icons such as Batman, Wonder,
                            and Superman.</p>

                            <strong>Early Life </strong> The son of Jack and Celia Lieber, Stanley Martin Lieber, was
                            born on December 28, 1922 in Manhattan, New York City. He attended DeWitt High Clinton High
                            School in the Bronx. He would
                            spend his youth working as an office boy, writing obituary for the National Tuberculosis
                            Center, and selling subscriptions of the New York Herald Tribune paper.</p>

                            <br>
                            <strong>Timely Comics </strong> In 1939 Lee became an assistant at Timely Comics, which will
                            later become Marvel Comics,
                            where he starts off proofreading their writers work. His first chance to write for Timely
                            was in the letter pages on the back of Captain America comics under the pseudonym Stan
                            Lee (a play on his name Stanley).</p>

                            <br>
                            <strong>Editor-in-Chief </strong> Lee, at the age of 19, became interim editor at Timely
                            when creator Jack Kirby left
                            Timely. Though the gig was meant only as a temporary one until a permanent replace could
                            be found, Lee proved himself and remained editor-in-chief until 1972.

                            <strong>The Face of Marvel</strong>  Lee became a figurehead and public face for Marvel Comics. He made appearances at comic book conventions around America, lecturing at colleges and participating in panel discussions. Lee and John Romita Sr. launched the Spider-Man newspaper comic strip on January 3, 1977. Lee's final collaboration with Jack Kirby, The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience, was published in 1978 as part of the Marvel Fireside Books series and is considered to be Marvel's first graphic novel. Lee and John Buscema produced the first issue of The Savage She-Hulk (February 1980), which introduced the female cousin of the Hulk, and crafted a Silver Surfer story for Epic Illustrated #1 (Spring 1980).

                            He moved to California in 1981 to develop Marvel's TV and movie properties. He was an executive producer for, and made cameo appearances in Marvel film adaptations and other movies. He occasionally returned to comic book writing with various Silver Surfer projects including a 1982 one-shot drawn by John Byrne, the Judgment Day graphic novel illustrated by John Buscema, the Parable limited series drawn by French artist MÅ“bius, and The Enslavers graphic novel with Keith Pollard. Lee was briefly president of the entire company, but soon stepped down to become publisher instead, finding that being president was too much about numbers and finance and not enough about the creative process he enjoyed. Lee continued his work promoting Marvel brand until his death in 2018.
